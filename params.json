CSD comes with\r\nmany functions that can parse, pull, push information in and out of\r\nCsound scores.  In the future, there are plans to provide equivalent\r\nfunctions for Csound orchestras.\r\n\r\nThis package ships with a few demo scripts that can be of great use to\r\nanyone who writes Csound music the old fashion way, that is, with a text\r\neditor. The ``sco_align`` script will save you from repeatedly typing\r\n'space-down-left' by aligning Csound scores auto-magically.  If you need\r\nto run a dozen or more pfields through a function, ``pfunc`` lets your\r\nwrite your own function and choose which instruments and pfields to\r\noperate on with a single command-line in a terminal window.  Or if you\r\nare organizing your pfields, and decided that amp would work better on\r\npfield 4 and pitch on pfield 5, then ``swap_columns`` is just what you\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIn order to use these demo scripts, you'll need to use a command-line\r\nterminal.  However, using these scripts in applications may be possible\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer of a Csound front-end, Csound based-app, or are\r\njust looking to extend the capabilities of your favorites text editor,\r\nlet me know so we can start the process of figuring out our respective\r\nneeds to make this happen. I'm open to any and all ideas from anyone.\r\n\r\nThis package is currently still very early in the development cycle,\r\nthough quickly approaching a beta release.  The scripts have been tested\r\nprimarily with Apple's Python 2.5.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
