About
-----

CSD is a Python package designed to allow simple text manipulation of
Csound code.

The purpose of this package is to make life easier for Csounders. As of
now, several demo scripts built with CSD are included as part of
the package, albeit not thoroughly tested.  With these scripts, you will
be able to automatically align your score code, do simple score
arpeggiations, replace repeated pfield values with the carry
preprocessor symbol (.), etc.

At the moment, the focus is on score manipulation, though room has been
made in the package structure to accomodate for orchestra processing as
well.

In order to use these scripts, you'll need to use the command-line.
However, using these scripts in applications may be possible in the
future.  If you are a developer of a Csound front-end, Csound based-app,
or are just looking to extend the capabilities of your favories text
editor, let me know so we can start the process of figuring out our
respective needs to make this happen.  If you aren't a developer, but
you feel you have some good ideas, feel free to contact, too.

This package is currently still very early in the development cycle,
though quickly approaching a beta release.  The scripts have been tested
primarily with Apple's Python 2.5.1.

.. warning::  Use these at your own risk. CSD should be
   considered experimental.
